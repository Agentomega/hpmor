-Rowling owns Harry Potter, and no one owns the methods of rationality.
-
-This fic is widely considered to have really hit its stride starting at around 
-Chapter 5. If you still don't like it after Chapter 10, give up.

-Reviews make me happy. You can leave reviews on any chapter, no login required, 
-and there's no need to finish reading it all before you start reviewing 
-chapters---but do please leave at most \emph{one} review per chapter.
-
-This is \emph{not} a strict single-point-of-departure fic---there exists a 
-primary point of departure, at some point in the past, but also other 
-alterations. The best term I've heard for this fic is "parallel universe".
-
-The text contains many clues: obvious clues, not-so-obvious clues, truly 
-obscure hints which I was shocked to see some readers successfully decode, and 
-massive evidence left out in plain sight. This is a rationalist story; its 
-mysteries are solvable, and meant to be solved.
-
-The pacing of the story is that of serial fiction, i.e., that of a TV show 
-running for a predetermined number of seasons, whose episodes are individually 
-plotted but with an overall arc building to a final conclusion.
-
-The story has been corrected to British English up to Ch. 17, and further 
-Britpicking is currently in progress (see the /HPMOR subreddit).
-
-All science mentioned is real science. But please keep in mind that, beyond the 
-realm of science, the views of the characters may not be those of the author. 
-Not everything the protagonist does is a lesson in wisdom, and advice offered 
-by darker characters may be untrustworthy or dangerously double-edged.
