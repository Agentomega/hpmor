Not all occurences of all-caps text have been changed to
correctly-capitalized small-caps. This is especially true for chapters
84 and up.

Replace \emph with \parsel (and make a \parsel macro for
parseltongue). Maybe a script font? Not just italics, though.

Chapter 86: Find a better way to format the hypotheses, and maybe the intro.

Figure out how to rename the Omakase Files chapters to Appendices or something.
